PirateBaby V0.1 Preview
#######################

NOTE: This is a Preview release for the RIOTdigital Tag-Team Coding Competition 2011. It is indicative of the direction the game will take and is considered playable, but by no means finished!

PirateBaby is an open-source, multi-platform, virtual pet game in which you can feed, wash and care your baby to let it grow to different forms!

Controls
########

PirateBaby is controlled using a touch/mouse interface, touch the top of the screen to open the panel. More actions will become available which are triggered by events.

An alternative control scheme is provided for non-touch devices(and for convenience).

L/R Buttons - Switch the selected panel item.
B - Close panel.
A - Activate selected button in panel.
L + R Quit

Other Notes
###########

PirateBaby is using PenjinTwo and with this adds some experimental new features.
   -PenjinPrescale: you can change the resolution of the project in the settings.ini file. This will scale the graphics and
       positioning. Note this feature is experimental and still has some issues, most notably that Text is not scaled
       properly!
   -Localisation: You can change the language in settings.ini and Penjin will create a new language file. You can edit text
       here to translate the game.
